# basic_programming
This repository includes codes and programs for begineer engineering students in C, MATLAB and Shell.

This repository has four folders for different topics. These are as follows:

1. C Programs
- This folder has topic wise C programs for begineers. You will find .c files on simple as well as some difficult topics in C Programming.
- Many files have obvious names which convey what does that program do or else you will find Comment on the very first line of every file about what that program does. Some programs are so simple and small that you can just understand them by looking.

2. Data Structures and Algorithms
- This folder has programs for Data structures and algorithms(Begineer) course. All the data structures are implemented using C language and with clear comments a about working.
- All the files have comments on top describing the code and the code itself is very clear and functional.
	eg. Hashmaps, Linked lists, Arrays, Queues, Stacks, etc.

3. MATLAB
- This folder has programs written in MATLAB. Programs comprise of simple as well as difficult problems.
- In the folder you can see the MATLAB files and some PDF files also which have the code as well as the complete OUTPUT of the programs.

4. Shell Scripts
- This folder has Shell scripting (.sh) files which are coded for linux.
- You may find begineer level basic shell programming and some difficult sripts too.
- Loops, conditions, patters and logical programming covered.


**I wish I could help someone with these programs who is starting programming and wants to practice problems.
** These can also prove helpful to the people who have urgent submission or lab exam.
